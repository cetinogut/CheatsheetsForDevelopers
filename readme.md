### CheatSheets & Learning Paths
This is a collection of resources that I use during my development. I hope these files help other fellow developers

### Do I need a cheat-sheet? 
Short answer is a big "YES".
Cheat sheets are useful in the case where youâ€™re using a tool whose implementation details are so freaking complicated that you need a summary of how to accomplish common tasks with it. 
The internet and google is under your hand all the time. But it might be still useful to be able to see all key commands, elements in one or two pages.
